# deep-learning-workshop
This is the supporting materials for a deep learning workshop developed by Evan Carey, to be presented at the International Conference on Health Policy Statistics in San Diego on 1/6/2020.  

## Introduction and software installation video
Please watch this video for a brief introduction and instructions on how to prepare your computer for the workshop. We will be using Python and Tensorflow (no GPU required, you can run on a laptop) for this course. You have the option of setting up a local install of Tensorflow via Anaconda, or you can use the google colab cloud environment which requires a google account, but no setup on your computer.
