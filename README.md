# deep-learning-workshop
This is the supporting materials for a deep learning workshop developed by Evan Carey, to be presented at the International Conference on Health Policy Statistics in San Diego on 1/6/2020.  

## Introduction and software installation video

(video to be uploaded by Saturday 1/4 @ 10 AM CT)

Please watch this video for a brief introduction and instructions on how to prepare your computer for the workshop. We will be using Python and Tensorflow (no GPU required, you can run on a laptop) for this course. You have the option of setting up a local install of Tensorflow via Anaconda, or you can use the google colab cloud environment which requires a google account, but no setup on your computer. So if you would like to follow-along and run code, you must either:  
* install tensorflow to your computer via anaconda 
* or use your google account to log into google colab

Please watch the video and attempt setup prior to coming to the workshop if at all possible! The workshop is a short two hours with 50+ registered attendees. We will not have time to troubleshoot installations during that two hours. If you have any questions or issues, I will be available to trouble shoot in person from 7:00-7:50 AM on Monday, 1/6, at the conference near the workshop areas. I will update this page with my exact location once I arrive and sort it out :)
